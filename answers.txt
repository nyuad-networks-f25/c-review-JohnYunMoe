PLAYING AROUND WITH MAKEFILE
(1) The error is that the main.c file is empty, the fix is to add a couple lines of code that do something or to 
    just return 0.
(2) By making a .gitignore file and adding the name of the executable file in that file. 
(3) The inefficiency is that everytime the make command is run, the executable is updated even though there is 
    nothing to update. One way to make sure this doesn't happen is to include a couple of lines of code in the script
    so that the output file is only overwritten if actual changes are made. It might also help to make sure that the
    proper dependencies are being tracked in the C files.
(4) The error is that there is no "bool" type in C. Only 0 and 1 exist. The fix is to either include the std.bool 
    header or just change it to be type int and change the value to be an int, either 0 or 1.  
(5) Included stdbool header so no errors when running make. 
(6) Done in makefile. 
(7) Errors are : "unknown type name ‘student_t’" and "unused variable ‘student1’". The fix is to include the 
    student.h header into the main.c.
