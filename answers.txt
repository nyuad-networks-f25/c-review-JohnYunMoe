(1) The error is that the main.c file is empty, the fix is to add a couple lines of code that do something or to 
    just return 0.
(2) By making a .gitignore file and adding the name of the executable file in that file. 
(3) The inefficiency is that everytime the make command is run, the executable is updated even though there is 
    nothing to update. One way to make sure this doesn't happen is to include a couple of lines of code in the script
    so that the output file is only overwritten if actual changes are made. It might also help to make sure that the
    proper dependencies are being tracked in the C files.
